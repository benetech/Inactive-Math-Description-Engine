Graph.tk is being rewritten from scratch (again). Developers can check out the "gl" branch here, and [javascript-cas](https://github.com/aantthony/javascript-cas) which handles the math related stuff.

Graph.tk is a web application that graphs, solves, simplifies, integrates and differentiates expressions. Currently, it can differentiate most of the functions it knows, but there are many bugs. It cannot expand or factorize properly yet, so it cannot find inverses well, or solve equations.
It can currently solve already factorized expressions like: 0=(x^2 /12-log(2))*(x-1)(x+3).

### Try it out
[graph.tk](http://graph.tk/) is the website which this code is used on. [aantthony.github.com](http://aantthony.github.com/) is much more powerful and up to date but currently has a lot of bugs.

### Requirements:
* JQuery
* MathQuill
* A browser that supports the html5 canvas tag.

### More information about this application.
* [Install Graph.tk as a Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkhkaamdeplibnmodcgodlkghphdbahk)
* http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/graph-plotter/
* http://graph.tk/about

### Stats
* 23,559 functions graphed.

### Known Bugs
* Some of the derivitives it finds are incorrect.
* Cannot solve x+x=0, but can solve 2x=0.

### Things planned
* Access external data? csv, fft, images, stock market data
* 3D! the whole graph thing rotates in an animation to become a flat plane, and then the 3d function is plotted.
