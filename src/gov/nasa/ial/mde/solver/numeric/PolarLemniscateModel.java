/**
 * A lemniscate is the locus of points in the plane, the product of whose
 * distances to two points located symmetrically about the origin is
 * exactly the square of the distance of each point from the origin. For
 * example, if the two points in question are (-a, 0) and (a, 0), then the
 * polar equation of the curve will be <code>r^2 = 2a^2*cos(2*theta)</code>. 
 * This curve will be the locus of points, the product of whose distances from 
 * the two points is exactly <code>a^2</code>. The general polar equation of a 
 * lemniscate is <code>r^2 = 2*a^2*cos(2*(\theta-\phi))</code> where <code>a</code>
 * is the distance from each point to the origin and <code>\phi</code> is the 
 * inclination of the line joining the two points.
