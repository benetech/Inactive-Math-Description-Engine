/**
 * Trochoids are curves traced by points fixed to circles which roll about other 
 * circles in the plane. Families of trochoids are distinguished by their 
 * frequency <code>\omega</code> and amplitude <code>a</code>. A common example
 * is the heart-shaped cardioid given by <code>r = 1 - sin (theta)</code> where 
 * both <code>\omega</code> and <code>a</code> are unity. The general equation 
 * is given by <code>r = 1 - a*cos(\omega*(\theta-\phi)</code> where <code>a</code> 
 * is the amplitude, <code>\omega</code> is the frequency, and <code>\phi</code> 
 * determines the orientation of the figure. Values of a less than unity result 
 * in a wiggly cy simple closed curve topologically equivalent to a circle; 
 * values greater than 1 cause the curve to have loops that appear in pairs -- a
 * major loop and a corresponding smaller reflected loop. As a approaches 
 * infinity,  the minor reflections grow to approach the size of their major 
 * counterparts, and the curve begins to look like a polar rose.
