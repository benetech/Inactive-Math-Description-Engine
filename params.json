{"name":"Math Description Engine","body":"![Benetech Logo](http://socialcoding4good.org/sites/default/files/u2/BenetechLogo.png)\r\n### Welcome to the Math Description Engine Open Source Project\r\nTeaching mathematics and science to blind and low vision students is particularly difficult when there are visual requirements. MathTrax is a graphing tool for middle school and high school students to graph equations, physics simulations or plot data files. The graphs have descriptions and sound so you can hear and read about the graph. NASA mathematicians created MathTrax in 2006 and its underlying Math Description Engine (MDE) is open source. To learn how blind students benefit from MathTrax, watch this demonstration by Nicole Torcolini, a computer science student at Stanford who used MathTrax in high school: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYguWVcQhNk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYguWVcQhNk)\r\n\r\n[Benetech](http://benetech.org), a 501c(3) nonprofit, hopes to leverage the MDE to improve the accessibility of science and math textbooks in [Bookshare](http://bookshare.org), which has nearly 200,000 student members with print disabilities (e.g. blind, low vision, dyslexic, cerebral palsy). Benetech is also the organization behind[SocialCoding4Good](http://SocialCoding4Good.org), which aims to recruit software professionals to volunteer with organizations that develop Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS), such as Wikimedia Foundation, FrontlineSMS, The Guardian Project, Universal Subtitles and Benetech.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMathTrax and the MDE were originally created at NASA by Terry Hodgson and Robert O. Shelton ([http://prime.jsc.nasa.gov/mathtrax/](http://prime.jsc.nasa.gov/mathtrax/)).  Bruce Walker and Benjamin Davison at Georgia Tech have also significantly contributed to this project.  Benetech is now a contributor to this project.\r\n\r\n### Developer Documentation\r\nDeveloper documentation can be found at [http://prime.jsc.nasa.gov/mde/](http://prime.jsc.nasa.gov/mde/)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n* Public mailing list is at [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/math-description-engine](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/math-description-engine)\r\n* IRC: [#benetech-mde](irc://chat.freenode.net/#benetech-mde)\r\n","tagline":"Helping blind and visually impaired students learn Math","google":"UA-2390830-11","note":"Don't delete this file!
