<h3>Welcome to the Math Description Engine Open Source Project</h3>

<p>Teaching mathematics and science to blind and low vision students is particularly difficult when there are visual requirements. MathTrax is a graphing tool for middle school and high school students to graph equations, physics simulations or plot data files. The graphs have descriptions and sound so you can hear and read about the graph. NASA mathematicians created MathTrax in 2006 and its underlying Math Description Engine (MDE) is open source. To learn how blind students benefit from MathTrax, watch this demonstration by Nicole Torcolini, a computer science student at Stanford who used MathTrax in high school:</p>

<p><a href="http://benetech.org">Benetech</a>, a 501c(3) nonprofit, hopes to leverage the MDE to improve the accessibility of science and math textbooks in <a href="http://bookshare.org">Bookshare</a>, which has nearly 200,000 student members with print disabilities (e.g. blind, low vision, dyslexic, cerebral palsy). Benetech is also the organization behind <a href="http://SocialCoding4Good.org">SocialCoding4Good</a>, which aims to recruit software professionals to volunteer with organizations that develop Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS), such as Wikimedia Foundation, FrontlineSMS, The Guardian Project, Universal Subtitles and Benetech.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>MathTrax and the MDE were originally created at NASA by Terry Hodgson, Robert O. Shelton and Stephanie Smith (<a href="http://prime.jsc.nasa.gov/mathtrax/">http://prime.jsc.nasa.gov/mathtrax/</a>).  Bruce Walker and Benjamin Davison at Georgia Tech have also significantly contributed to this project.  Benetech is now a contributor to this project.</p>

<h3>Developer Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>MathTrax is a desktop application, which limits its adoption and the ability to embed it directly into EPUB 3 digital textbooks, which are based on modern HTML5 technologies.  We would like to challenge developers to enable the MDE to generate HTML5 SVG graphics and use MathML for math rendering. Developers should consider using <a href="http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/">http://jsxgraph.uni-bayreuth.de/wp/</a> for SVG support and MathJax for MathML rendering <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">http://www.mathjax.org</a>
</li><li>Another advantage of using SVG graphics is that they are optimal for printing tactile graphics using embossers from companies, such as ViewPlus (<a href="http://www.viewplus.com/">http://www.viewplus.com/</a>).  Modern consumer grade 3D printers, such as MakerBotâ€™s Thing-O-Matic, have the disruptive potential to make tactile graphics cheaper, more broadly available and more useful.  We would like to challenge developers to prototype creating tactile diagrams and shapes that help teach mathematics and science.  Developers attending the TechShop location in San Francisco should have access to the 3D printer there.
</li><li>MathTrax uses a sound sweep to audibly convey the graph in addition to the description. We would like to challenge developers to use the HTML5 Web Audio API to generate auditory representations of graphs without the need for Java components.
</li><li>Students usually find the auditory sweep helpful, with one major exception. When a sound sweep is played, the value of the x axis is conveyed by time and that of the y axis by pitch. The case when this does not work is in polar coordinates where the graph curves backwards in the negative x direction. An interesting and useful challenge posed by a blind student user is to try to develop a way to indicate horizontal as well as vertical direction in a sound sweep.
</li><li>We also like to challenge developers to create additional templates for teaching common core standards or enhancing current descriptions.  For example, it would be good to enrich descriptions of sine waves with explanations that include the concepts of frequency and amplitude.
</li><li>We would like to challenge developers to integrate the MDE with our open source Poet tool for crowdsourcing image descriptions (<a href="https://github.com/benetech/ImageDescService">http://github.com/benetech/ImageDescService</a> and <a href="https://diagram-center.herokuapp.com/">https://diagram-center.herokuapp.com/</a>). You can try the Poet tool with the OER textbooks at: <a href="http://www.bookshare.org/browse/collection/34">http://www.bookshare.org/browse/collection/34</a> .  Download any of the DAISY format books with images and upload to Poet.  An additional idea is to integrate with Poet a math handwriting recognition system such as <a href="http://research.cs.queensu.ca/drl//ffes/">http://research.cs.queensu.ca/drl//ffes/</a> or <a href="http://mathfor.mi.fu-berlin.de/docs/techreport-B-07-01.pdf">http://mathfor.mi.fu-berlin.de/docs/techreport-B-07-01.pdf</a>, so that volunteers do not need to know how to enter complex formulas in LaTex or MathML.
